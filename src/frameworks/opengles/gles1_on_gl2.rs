//! Implementation of OpenGL ES 1.1 on top of OpenGL 2.1 compatibility profile.
//!
//! The standard graphics drivers on most desktop operating systems do not
//! provide OpenGL ES 1.1, so we must provide it ourselves somehow.
//!
//! OpenGL ES 1.1 is based on OpenGL 1.5. Much of its core functionality (e.g.
//! the fixed-function pipeline) is considered legacy and not available in the
//! "core profile" for modern OpenGL versions, nor is it available at all in
//! later versions of OpenGL ES. However, OpenGL also has the "compatibility
//! profile" which still offers this legacy functionality.
//!
//! OpenGL 2.1 is the latest version that has a compatibility profile available
//! on macOS. It's also a version supported on various other OSes.
//! It is therefore a convenient target for our implementation.
