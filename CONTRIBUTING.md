# Contributing to touchHLE

Please run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` on your changes before committing. For the handful of C and C++ files, please use `clang-format -i` to format them.

If you're going to open a pull request with non-trivial changes, please talk to us first so we can figure out if we're likely to accept them. It would be a shame if your effort had to be wasted.
