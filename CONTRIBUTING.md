# Contributing to touchHLE

## General

Please be kind and respectful to others.

It's especially important to value and respect others' time and energy: don't demand or expect anything to happen on any particular timescale, or even for anyone to do anything at all. We're all volunteers here, doing things for the love of it, and if you force us to spend a lot of time on _you_, it's going to slowly chip away at our passion and enthusiasm.

**⚠️ Do not talk about using pirated content.**<br>
**⚠️ You _will_ be banned if you ignore this warning.**<br>

## Issues

Please bear in mind that there are infinitely many apps that do not work in touchHLE right now, so please don't open issues about apps that aren't in the supported list, unless you've got it partially working (e.g. loaded up to the menu but the main game doesn't work). The fact that an app's splash screen (Default.png) shows up doesn't mean it's partially working.

## Code contributions

Please run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` on your changes before committing. For the handful of C and C++ files, please use `clang-format -i` to format them.

If you're going to open a pull request with non-trivial changes, please talk to us first so we can figure out if we're likely to accept them. It would be a shame if your effort had to be wasted.
